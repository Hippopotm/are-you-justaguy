# Are You Just a Guy? 🍻

A single-player Reddit-based training game that teaches men bystander intervention and respect standards through realistic, confessional scenarios. Built for the Reddit + Kiro Community Games Challenge.

## 🎯 What This Game Is

**"Are You Just a Guy?"** is a single-player educational game that helps men practice being better allies through humor and real-world scenarios. Players read Reddit-style confessional stories about uncomfortable social situations and choose how they'd respond, learning evidence-based intervention techniques along the way.

The game runs inline directly within Reddit posts, providing an immediate, seamless experience without popups or external navigation. Players see their progress tracked on a visual "Trash Meter" with real Reddit avatars, including their own profile picture riding along the progress bar.

- **Choose your response** from 3 shuffled options (A/B/C) based on real intervention frameworks
- **Get exact scores** of 0%, 60%, or 100% (no gradual scoring)

# Are You Just a Guy? 🤖

A single-player Reddit-based bystander intervention training game that teaches men to be better allies through realistic, confessional scenarios. Built for the Reddit + Kiro Community Games Challenge.

## 🎯 What This Game Is

**"Are You Just a Guy?"** is an inline educational game that helps men practice bystander intervention skills through humor and real-world scenarios.

The game runs completely inline within Reddit posts with immediate gameplay - no splash screens or barriers to entry. Players track their progress on a visual "Trash Meter" featuring their real Reddit avatar that bounces and moves along a progress bar based on their overall average score.

## Content Guidelines

### Tone & Voice
- **Reddit confessional style**: "So this happened..." "I didn't know what to do..."
- **First-person or close-third perspective**
- **Casual, relatable language** - how people actually talk
- **No graphic violence or trauma details**
- **No victim-blaming or shaming language**

### Body Requirements
- **120-220 words** of story context
- **Realistic social situations** men encounter
- **Clear stakes** - what happens if they don't act vs. if they do
- **Emotional nuance** - not black and white, but clear better/worse choices

### Choice Design
- **Exactly 3 choices** (A, B, C)
- **One safer choice** (90-100 points) that demonstrates the standard
- **One partial choice** (55-75 points) that's better than nothing but not ideal  
- **One riskier choice** (0-40 points) that's problematic or passive
- **Realistic options** - things men would actually consider doing

### Standards Integration
- **5Ds**: Direct, Distract, Delegate, Delay, Document
- **DEARMAN**: Describe, Express, Assert, Reinforce, Mindful, Appear Confident, Negotiate
- **LIVES**: Listen, Inquire, Validate, Enhance Safety, Support
- **COOPER**: White, Yellow, Orange, Red (awareness states)

### Micro-scripts
- **Default**: Direct, clear, usable in real situations
- **Gentle**: Softer version for sensitive contexts
- **One sentence each** - something someone could actually say
- **Non-confrontational** but clear

## Example Input
```
Framework: 5Ds
Step: Distract  
Setting: Bar
Context: Guy won't leave woman alone, she looks uncomfortable
```
